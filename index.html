                Saddonti, I Love You, Today is a special day.
                Today is the day where my love is birthed, Today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other.
                Today is 22/2/2025. Let's go back to Sunday 22/02/2009 when you were born. 
                The moon was like this since he was shy to be brighter when you were born, he let you shine, and now let me talk about what you bring to my life:
            </p>
            <p>
                You are my moon. When you entered my life, you brightened it. 
                You make me laugh when I start thinking of you. I can't imagine a day without you. 
                I Love you very much, My Moon. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåë
            </p>
            <p>
                Saddonti, 9/5/2024 was the first time we talked, and it was one of the most beautiful days. That day made us friends, then best friends, then lovers, and now more than lovers‚Äîwe are one soul. 
                And soon, we will become (ÿ≤Ÿàÿ¨ & ÿ≤Ÿàÿ¨ÿ©). 
                That day, I felt something I had never felt before. I sensed that something was going to happen, even though I never expected you would love me back, 
                especially because you had just come out of something and were not ready to go through it again. But I proved to you that I would never take you back to zero, I will take you to 100. 
                Because I am not toxic, not a player, not dirty‚ÄîI am keeping you safe because I truly love you.
            </p>
            <p>
                9/5/2024 was a beautiful day because I felt the missing piece of my heart was with you, even though you didn't love me yet. 
                But you knew I had a crush on you for a long time üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏èüòù‚ù§Ô∏è. 
                So I held on to you and bet that one day, you would become my beloved‚Äîand you did. üòù 
                You will always be the candle that lights my life, the light of my eyes, my heart, and its beating rhythm. 
                You made me love life, you made me live and enjoy living. You gave me hope in life again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you so much, my light ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. 
                I pray that we stay together forever, get married, and you become my wife and the mother of our children‚Äîmy love, my soul. 
                Allah bless you, baby ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. 
                Allah never separate me from you, my eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. 
                Allah protect you, my life‚Äôs candle ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baby, you are not just beautiful. You are everything.
                Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days, and your voice feels like home.
                I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you.
                You are my definition of perfect.
            </p>
