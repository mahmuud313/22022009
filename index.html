            <p>Saddonti, I Love You, Today is a special day.</p>
            <p>Today is the day where my love is birthed, Today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other, Today is 22/2/2025.</p>
            <p>Let's go back to Sunday 22/02/2009 when you were born. The moon was shy to shine brighter because it knew you were the one who would bring light into my life.</p>
            <p>You are my moon. When you entered my life, you brightened it. You make me laugh whenever I think of you. I can't imagine a day without you. I love you so much, my moon. ❤️❤️🌑</p>
            
            <p>9/5/2024 was the first day we talked. That day changed everything. We became friends, then besties, then lovers. And now, we are more than lovers—we are one soul, and one day we will be (زوج & زوجة).</p>
            
            <p>That day, I felt something I had never felt before. I knew something special was about to happen, even though I never expected you would love me back. You had just gone through something, and I knew you weren’t ready to start over. But I proved to you that I wouldn’t take you back to zero—I would take you to 100. I am not toxic, not a player, not a liar. I have always protected you because I love you truly.</p>
            
            <p>9/5/2024 was a beautiful day because I found the missing piece of my heart in you. Even if you didn’t love me at first, you knew I had a crush on you for a long time 🙂‍↔️😝❤️. I held onto you tightly and believed in us, and now you are my love. You are the candle that lights my life, the light in my eyes, the beat of my heart. You made me love life, you made me enjoy every moment. You brought hope back into my world.</p>

            <p>I love you so much, my moon. ❤️❤️ I pray we stay together forever, get married, and build a life together. You will be the mother of my children, my everything. ❤️🫂</p>
            
            <p>May Allah bless and protect you, my love. ❤️❤️ May Allah never take you away from me. You are my light, my everything. ❤️❤️</p>
            
            <p><strong>Baby,</strong> you’re not just beautiful. You’re everything. Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days, and your voice feels like home. I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you. You are my definition of perfect.</p>
