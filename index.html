            <h2>To My Princess</h2>
            <p>
                Saddonti, I Love You, Today is a special day.<br>
                Today is the day where my love is birthed, Today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other. Today is 22/2/2025.<br><br>

                Let's go back to Sunday 22/02/2009 when you were born. The moon was shy to shine more because he let you be the brightest star.<br><br>

                Now let me talk about what you mean in my life: You are my moon. When you entered my life, you brightened it. You make me laugh whenever I think of you. I can't imagine a day without you.<br><br>

                Saddonti, 9/5/2024 was the first time we talked, and it was one of the best days of my life. That day made us friends, then besties, then lovers, and now more than lovers‚Äîwe are one soul. And one day, we will become (ÿ≤Ÿàÿ¨ & ÿ≤Ÿàÿ¨ÿ©).<br><br>

                That day, I felt something I had never felt before. I felt that something special was going to happen. Even though I never expected you to love me, especially because you had just come out of something painful, I showed you that I wouldn't take you back to zero‚ÄîI would lift you to 100 because I am not toxic, I am not a player, I am not bad. I cherish you because I love you truly.<br><br>

                9/5/2024 was a beautiful day because I found the missing piece of my heart‚Äîyou. Even if you didn‚Äôt love me then, you know I had been crushing on you for a long time. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏èüòù‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>

                I will never let you go. I held onto you, I bet on you, and now you are my love. You are the candle that lights my life, the light in my eyes, my heart, and its every beat. You made me love life, you gave me hope. You brought happiness into my world.<br><br>

                I love you so much, my light ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, and I pray we stay together forever, get married, and you become my wife and the mother of my children. My love, my soul ‚ù§Ô∏èü´Ç<br><br>

                Allah ykhalili eyek baby ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                Allah ma yehrmne menik ya 3yoone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
                Allah yehfazle eyek ya sham3et hayete ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>

                Baby, you are not just beautiful‚Äîyou are everything. Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days, and your voice feels like home. I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you. You are my definition of perfect.
