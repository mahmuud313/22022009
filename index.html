            <p>To My Princess,</p>
            <p>
                Saddonti, I Love You. Today is a special day.  
                Today is the day where my love was birthed. Today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other.  
                Today is 22/2/2025.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's go back to Sunday, 22/02/2009, when you were born.  
                The moon was shy that night, letting you shine brighter.  
                You are my moon, the light in my life.  
                You make me smile just by thinking of you. I can't imagine a day without you.  
                I love you so much, my moon. ❤️❤️🌑  
            </p>
            <p>
                Saddonti, 9/5/2024 was the first time we talked. It was one of the best days of my life.  
                That day made us friends, then best friends, then lovers, and now something beyond love.  
                One day, we will be husband and wife.  
            </p>
            <p>
                That day, I felt something I never felt before. I knew something special was about to happen.  
                Even though I didn't expect you to love me back, I never gave up on you.  
                And now, you are my everything. I will never let you go.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Baby, you're not just beautiful. You're everything.  
                Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days,  
                and your voice feels like home. I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you.  
                You're my definition of perfect.  
            </p>
