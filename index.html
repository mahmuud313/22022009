            To My Princess:
        </p>

        <p>
            Saddonti, I Love You, Today is a special day.<br>
            Today is the day where my love is birthed, today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other. Today is 22/2/2025.<br>
            Let's go back to Sunday 22/02/2009 when you were born. The moon was like this since it was shy to be brighter more when you were born. It let you brighten, and now let me talk about what you make in my life:<br>
            You are my moon. When you entered my life, you brightened it. You make me laugh when I start thinking of you. I can't imagine for a day to come when you are not with me. I Love you very much, my moon ❤️❤️🌑.
        </p>

        <p>
            Saddonti 9/5/2024<br>
            It was the first time we talked.<br>
            And it was one of the best days. That day we became friends, and we turned into best friends, then lovers, and now more than lovers, we became one soul, and after that, we became (husband and wife).<br>
            On this day, I felt something I had never felt in my whole life. I felt that something was going to happen, even though I had always thought it was impossible. But I didn’t expect that you would come into my life, especially after being away from me. But I proved to you that I would not let you go.<br>
            I want you to always be the one I love, the one I share my heart with.  
        </p>

        <p>
            On 9/5/2024, it was a beautiful day because I felt the missing piece of my heart when I found you by my side, even if you didn’t love me back.<br>
            But you know, I was a little unsure of us from the beginning 🙂‍↔️😝❤️.<br>
            I will never let you go, I’ll hold onto you, and I’m sure that you’ll become my beloved.<br>
            You are the light of my life, the one who brightens my eyes and heart. You made me love life and made me feel alive, and you restored my hope.<br>
            I love you so much, my light ❤️❤️, and I hope we’ll stay together forever, get married, and have children together. You’ll be the mother of my children, my love ❤️🫂.
        </p>

        <p>
            God, please keep her for me, my baby ❤️❤️.<br>
            God, never let me be without her, my love ❤️❤️.<br>
            God, protect her, my light ❤️❤️.<br>
            Baby, you're not just beautiful. You're everything. Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days, and your voice feels like home. I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you. You're my definition of perfect.
