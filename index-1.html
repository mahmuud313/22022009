        <h1>To My Princess</h1>
        <p>
            Saddonti, I Love You, Today is a special day.<br>
            Today is the day where my love is birthed, Today is the day when God wrote that our destinies are for each other, Today is 22/2/2025.<br><br>

            Let's go back to Sunday 22/02/2009 when you were born. The moon was like this since he was shy to be brighter when you were born, he let you shine.<br>
            And now let me talk about what you make in my life: You are my moon.<br>
            When you entered my life, you brightened it. You make me laugh when I start thinking of you. I can't imagine a day to come when you are not with me.<br>
            I Love you very much, My Moon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåë<br><br>

            Baby, You're not just beautiful. You're everything. Your eyes hold galaxies, your smile lights up my darkest days, and your voice feels like home. I could stare at you forever and still not have enough of you. You're my definition of perfect.<br><br>

            Every moment with you is a memory I hold close. This is a small reflection of the love we share in our journey.
